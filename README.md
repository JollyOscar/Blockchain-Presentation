# Blockchain Presentation (GitHub Pages)

A simple, modern, slide-style webpage based on the group research:
**“Is Blockchain Still Relevant in 2026?”**

## What’s included
- `index.html` — the content (5 “slides” as sections)
- `styles.css` — modern styling (responsive, accessible)
- `script.js` — keyboard navigation + active slide indicator

## Customize
1. Open `index.html`
2. On Slide 1, replace the group-member placeholders:
   - `[Name 1]`, `[Name 2]`, etc.

## Publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a GitHub repo (example: `blockchain-presentation`)
2. Commit and push these files to the repo root
3. In GitHub:
   - Go to **Settings → Pages**
   - Under **Build and deployment**
   - **Source:** “Deploy from a branch”
   - **Branch:** `main` and `/ (root)`
4. Wait ~1–2 minutes; GitHub will show your live URL.

## Presenting tips
- Use keyboard arrow keys **← / →** to move between slides.
- Works offline: you can open `index.html` directly in a browser.

If you want, I can also add:
- a printable/PDF-friendly stylesheet,
- speaker notes per slide,
- or an auto-play mode.
